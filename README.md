# Image Processing

In this exercise you will be using StyleGAN2 Neural Network to perform different image reconstruction tasks.
The exercise is based on the work of Gabbay et al.

 - **GAN Inversion and Latent Optimization**
 - **Generative Models as Image Priors**
 - **Image Alignment**
 - **Image Reconstruction Tasks:**
  - Image Deblurring
  - Image Colorization
  - Image Inpainting
